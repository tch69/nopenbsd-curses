This is a port of the ncurses found in OpenBSD's source tree. 

Makefiles have been rewritten to make it a bit more portable.

But still it's not recommended for production uses... yet.

I hope I made as least mistakes as possible, just so I won't 
have to fix them (because I can't).

WIP: Right now, there variables are hard-coded in ncurses_cfg.h:

#define SYSTEM_NAME "linux-musl"
#define TERMINFO "/usr/share/terminfo"
#define TERMINFO_DIRS "/usr/share/terminfo:/usr/local/share/terminfo"

I'm too lazy to but I'll try to write a script to change that.
